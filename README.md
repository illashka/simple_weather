# Simple weather app
## To set up the app you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
In the root of the project run `node app.js`

Then write [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

## To get current weather
<p>On the home page, you can type in the name of your city and get the current weather, and then decide whether you should leave the house (not all cities, alas, are available)</p>
